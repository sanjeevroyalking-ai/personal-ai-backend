Remember all the times you succeeded before. Keep going—you’re doing amazing!”\n\nIn Tamil, pep talk-ஐ “உற்சாகமான உரையாடல்” என்று சொல்லலாம்.  \nHindi- में इसे कहते हैं “प्रोत्साहन भरा संदेश।”\n\nWant me to give you a pep talk anytime? I’m here for you! 💪😊"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ok"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Awesome, Sanjeev! 😊 Anytime you need a boost or just someone to cheer you on, just ask me.
